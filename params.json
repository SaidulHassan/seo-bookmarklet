{"name":"Ouiseo","tagline":"","body":"# OuiSEO\r\n\r\nAn open-source bookmarklet that shows you on-page SEO and social meta data information.\r\n\r\n## Why should I use this?\r\n\r\nAs an internet marketer you'll often find yourself looking at a website's source code to verify the page's title tag, meta description, see if the Facebook image meta tag was added, look at the text used for the Twitter card, etc. This process is tedious AND time consuming.\r\n\r\nOuiSEO was primarily built to save me time (and, let's be honest, to have some fun coding). If you have any ideas or suggestions please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/CarlSednaoui). If anything seems broken please [submit a Github issue](https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouiseo/issues/new).\r\n\r\n__Note:__ OuiSEO is an evolving project and new features may be added every now and then.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install OuiSEO simply go [here](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouiseo/install.html).\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n![OuiSEO Demo Image 1](http://f.cl.ly/items/202d2s2W2x2y1x2e0K1g/ouiseo_demo_1.png)\r\n![OuiSEO Demo Image 2](http://f.cl.ly/items/0o04060g0x301m3E3w16/ouiseo_demo_2.png)\r\n![OuiSEO Demo Image 3](http://f.cl.ly/items/2F1Q293i2w0R1R2v2m2G/ouiseo_demo_3.png)\r\n![OuiSEO Demo Image 4](http://f.cl.ly/items/0X421F1o1I0k0m0u2x0A/ouiseo_demo_4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nOuiSEO is greatly inspired by this [SEO Bookmarklet](http://twkm.ca/seo-bookmarklet/) made by Troy Meier.

We suggest that you give us an image of at least 200x200 pixels. However, bigger is better, so if you have a 1500x1500 image that you can use, please give it to us. We downsample and crop it for for people using smaller-resolution devices but will use it on a larger device. The larger this image is, the better engagement stories featuring it will get. (Note: image sizes must be no more than 5MB in size.)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- Refactor JS\r\n- Create minified version\r\n- Check if they use KM, GA, Mixpanel, Optimizely, VWO, MouseFlow, Google Remarketing, AdRoll, CrazyEgg\r\n- Add 'SEO' score?\r\n- Add 'SEO' suggestions?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
