## Notes
- Fb url = The URL should be the canonical address for the given page
- Fb title = Title should typically match page title
- Fb description = A short description or summary of the object.
- Fb type = Provides Facebook the type of website that you would like your website to be categorized by. [More info](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/opengraph/object-type/)
    - The og:type meta tag is necessary for Facebook to render a News Feed story that generates a high click-through rate.
- Fb img = The URL of an image which is used in stories published about this object. We suggest that you give us an image of at least 200x200 pixels. However, bigger is better, so if you have a 1500x1500 image that you can use, please give it to us. We downsample and crop it for for people using smaller-resolution devices but will use it on a larger device. The larger this image is, the better engagement stories featuring it will get. (Note: image sizes must be no more than 5MB in size.)
